0. Read config files -
    - user credentials
        - different for different regions?
        - CSP
            - regions
            - credentials
    - regions (compulsory from input)
    - have a specific location for these initial config files /conf folder
    - this will be during the build process
    - user pinned csps
    - config for XFaaS
        - deployment config
            - (start the xfaas service)
        - provenance config
            -
1. get user dag
    - user dag in the original form
    - class which represents user dag (check utils)
    - for multi region deployments we need to have the separate impl for each CSP in which
      the regions would be captured.


### Talk with varad and integrate ###
2. Apply apt optimisations(add collect logs here)
    - run partitioner-placement + fusion (needs discussion)
    - Generic partitioner algorithm

3. Generate resources
    - logging queues
    - storage groups etc.
4. Push user and refactored and resources' info to provenance
5. build
6. deploy
7. Deployment status and user and refactored functions push to provenance



partition plus fusion: brute force through all combinations of partition & fusion


meeet notes:

xFaaS deployment service (AWS Step Function, 1,2,3+4,5-7)
    params to invoke:
        csp config file, dag, function source zip, benchmark
xfaas provenance service - AWS lambda
    deploy the service while deploying xfaas service
    params:
        csp config file



Generic Partitioner
    - cplex baseline
    - dp based soln.


Region specific: Inter cloud Network plus pricing
CSP Specific: Function exec times

(verfication for performance across regions)
TODO - run the existing functions on different regions to see performance difference.



Incremental claims:

partition plus fusion
multi-multi cloud
edge (openfaas)
real world applications


-- mix and match for the fusion and the partition modules to be used independently and together.
